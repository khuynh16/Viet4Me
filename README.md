# Viet4Me

The project is a "self-learning" Vietnamese app where you are able to translate any word or phrase from English into Vietnamese. Alongside its translation, you are able to make posts and are able to categorize and filter certain posts to view! Think of it as a Google Translate meets Quizlet application.

## Project Link

As of 9/22/2020, the project is still being developed and has not yet been hosted to view in working order. Update link will be here (in the hopefully near future!).

## Functionality (as of 9/22/2020):

* Creating an account and storing in database
* Adding a post (comprised of entering an English word/phrase to translate, adding/choosing categories to store in)
* Editing a post (the phrase to translate, the categories the current post is stored in)
* Deleting a post

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
