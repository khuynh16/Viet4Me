# Viet4Me

The project is a "self-learning" Vietnamese app where you are able to translate any word or phrase from English into Vietnamese. Alongside its translation, you are able to make posts and are able to categorize and filter certain posts to view! Think of it as a Google Translate meets Quizlet application.
